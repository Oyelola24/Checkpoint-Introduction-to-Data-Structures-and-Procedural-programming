# Orthogonal Character Checker

This project implements a simple algorithm to check if pairs of vectors are **orthogonal** (i.e., their dot product is zero).

## üìò Description

The program reads multiple pairs of vectors and calculates their dot product. If the result is zero, it determines that the vectors are orthogonal.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Key Components

- **dot_product(v1, v2)**:  
  A function that calculates and returns the dot product of two vectors.

- **OrthogonalCharacterChecker**:  
  The main algorithm that reads vector inputs, computes their dot product, and prints whether they are orthogonal.

# Summation of Distinct Elements in Two Arrays

## Description

This pseudocode algorithm computes the **sum of all distinct elements** found in **two integer arrays**, excluding any elements that are **common to both arrays**.

### Example

Given:
- `cell1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]`
- `cell2 = [2, 4, 1, 7, 9]`

The common elements are: `1, 7, 9`  
The unique elements are: `3` (from `cell1`), and `2, 4` (from `cell2`)  
**Sum = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9**

## Features

- Checks for duplicates between two arrays
- Filters out common elements
- Calculates and outputs the sum of unique values

## Pseudocode Structure

- Uses two nested loops to check for duplicates
- Builds a dynamic array (`darr`) to hold distinct elements
- Adds the unique elements to the `sum`
- Outputs the final result

## Variables

- `cell1`, `cell2`: Input arrays of integers
- `darr`: Stores distinct non-common elements
- `sum`: Accumulates the sum of distinct elements
- `duplicate`: Boolean flag to track duplicates

## Output

Prints the **sum** of all distinct, non-common elements in the two arrays.

---

## How to Use

1. Copy the pseudocode into a compatible pseudocode interpreter or compiler (such as one using `.algo` syntax).
2. Run the program.
3. The output will be the sum of elements that appear in only one of the two arrays.
